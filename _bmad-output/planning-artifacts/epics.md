## Requirements Inventory

### Functional Requirements

FR1: The home page must display an interactive 3D globe with location markers colored by reef state (Thriving / Under pressure / Witnessing change) and in/out-of-season status.
FR2: The home page must include a filter rail supporting: reef condition, month range, skill level (cumulative), region, thermal heat level, animal tags (Sharks, Mantas, Turtles, Whales, Dolphins, Dugongs), freshness toggle, and sort options.
FR3: All filter state must persist in URL querystring via router.replace so filtered views are shareable and back-button-safe.
FR4: Location cards must display name, reef state badge, in-season badge, hero image, freshness line (thermal dot + survey dot with age), coral cover, and best season.
FR5: The globe and card grid must update live on filter change without a full page reload.
FR6: On mobile, the filter rail must collapse to a "Filters" button that opens a full-height left drawer; the globe must degrade to a list/card view.
FR7: Each site detail page must contain: Overview, Species & What You'll See, 12-month Conditions grid, Reef Health snapshot, Plan Your Trip (sticky sidebar desktop / bottom drawer mobile), Gear, and Related Sites sections.
FR8: The species section on site detail must merge curated species with sighting evidence showing: common name, scientific name, IUCN badge (feature-flagged), reliability, last confirmed date (in <time> element), 24-month rolling record count, proximity radius, iNaturalist photo with attribution.
FR9: The 12-month conditions grid must show water temp range, visibility range, and current strength per month, color-coded by current level, with the current month highlighted via ring-2 (not color alone).
FR10: The reef health section on site detail must link to the parent location reef state and display DHW thermal stress where present.
FR11: The gear section must present two layers: Layer A (cert-level base kit adapting to the site's cert floor) and Layer B (site-specific add-ons per site).
FR12: Plan Your Trip must appear as a sticky sidebar on desktop and a bottom-drawer CTA on mobile, covering Getting There, Where to Stay, and Who to Dive With, all affiliate-tracked via AffiliateLink component.
FR13: Wreck data must be displayed on site detail when wreck records exist (vessel name, type, sunk date, depth range, history).
FR14: Site detail pages must use generateStaticParams for static generation and include JSON-LD TouristAttraction schema.
FR15: Every quantitative claim on site and location detail pages must link inline to its source and methodology claim ID via <details>/<summary> disclosure.
FR16: Location pages must include a reef health panel: coral cover % (current vs historical with bars), bleached %, mortality %, DHW from NOAA nightly, survey date and method with DataFreshnessLabel.
FR17: Location pages must include a fishing pressure panel showing GFW AIS-tracked fishing hours within 50km with artisanal fishing blind spot caveat.
FR18: Location pages must display water quality events (severity, worst months, microplastics level, diving impact) when records exist.
FR19: Location pages must include a card grid of all child dive sites, each site card in-season aware.
FR20: Location pages must include a Plan Your Trip sidebar with Getting There, tiered lodging options, and dive operators, all via AffiliateLink.
FR21: Location pages must include a general gear section and JSON-LD Place schema.
FR22: The sites directory must display all sites in a card grid sorted by default editorial rank.
FR23: The sites directory must support free-text fuzzy search (fuse.js) across site name, location, country, and species (common and scientific names).
FR24: The sites directory must support the same filter controls as the Atlas home with URL-state persistence.
FR25: Each site card must show name, location, hero image, skill level badge, best months, dive types, confidence dot and "Sighting evidence pending" fallback when no records exist (never blank).
FR26: The system must provide one species explorer page per curated encounter for all 11 encounters at /where-to-see/[species].
FR27: Each species explorer page must show: hero, IUCN badge (feature-flagged), ethics note, best months strip, top 6 sites by editorial score, all atlas locations grouped by region (primary / secondary / emerging / closed).
FR28: All affiliate links must use the AffiliateLink component which fires Vercel Analytics events with site_id + partner + product_id context.
FR29: Affiliate disclosure must appear adjacent to all affiliate link blocks; full policy at /about. Non-affiliate operator links permitted as plain links.
FR30: /data page must document what is live (NOAA nightly), what is a snapshot, and what cannot be seen.
FR31: /faq page must document how each metric is calculated (coral cover methodology, DHW formula, reef state thresholds, sighting evidence 24-month window).
FR32: Per-claim source citations and methodology IDs must appear inline on site and location detail pages.
FR33: Data freshness labels must appear on every panel showing survey age; IUCN and GFW data refreshed weekly via automated workflows.
FR34: All 380 sites must have at least 1 sighting evidence record. Current gap: 136 sites. Backfill priority: editorial rank descending.
FR35: A visual evidence confidence badge must distinguish "Confirmed sightings on record" vs "No sighting records yet" on site cards and site detail hero.
FR36: MERMAID open API must be integrated to retrieve multi-year coral cover records per location, replacing the two-data-point comparison with a trend series (at least 3 data points for at least 5 locations).
FR37: A first-time visitor must be able to articulate the site's value proposition within 10 seconds without scrolling.
FR38: A search results page at /search?q= must group results by type (Locations / Sites / Species), handle no-results with suggestions, and support query refinement without page reload.
FR39: A species detail sub-route (/{location}/{site}/species/[slug]) must show species profile, sighting evidence at that site, 12-month seasonality, and links to the cross-atlas /where-to-see page.
FR40: The Witnessing change location variant must: promote reef science above copy, show honest label, render Plan Your Trip in muted style, and suppress hover lift on cards.
FR41: Cert-level landing pages (/for/[cert]) must exist for all 6 levels, each showing cert-filtered site grid, cert-appropriate copy, safety notes, and Layer A gear.

### Non-Functional Requirements

NFR1: Site detail pages LCP < 2.0s on 4G. Statically generated, images via Next.js <Image> with priority on hero only.
NFR2: Every page indexable with unique title / description / OG metadata. Sitemap covers all 380 sites, 113 locations, 11 encounters, 6 cert pages. JSON-LD schema.org per page type.
NFR3: WCAG AA on text contrast and keyboard nav. Globe has non-globe fallback. All interactive elements reachable by Tab in DOM order.
NFR4: Fully responsive. Globe degrades to list on mobile. Plan Your Trip becomes bottom drawer. Filters collapse to sheet. Stat strip scrolls horizontally.
NFR5: Every quantitative claim traceable to source + methodology. No headline stat without cited confidence level or caveat.
NFR6: FTC affiliate disclosure on every page with affiliate links. Vercel Analytics cookieless. TypeScript strict throughout.

### Additional Requirements (Architecture)

- Stack is locked: Next.js 16 App Router (Turbopack), React 19, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, TypeScript strict, Vercel hosting.
- Data is static JSON in src/data/ (locations.json, sites.json, gear.json). No database. Loaded at build time.
- Pre-built _index.json at build time for client-side filtering/search (compact subset: id, slug, name, lat, lng, bestMonths, skillLevel, diveTypes, speciesNames[], regionId).
- Search via fuse.js client-side. Weighted: name 3x, species 2x, location 1x.
- Filter state in URL querystring via router.replace (not push — back button must return to prior page, not prior filter state).
- Server components by default; globe, filter drawer, search input are client components ('use client').
- No global store. Diver profile (cert + recency) in localStorage via useDiverProfile() hook.
- Static generation: generateStaticParams on /sites/[slug] and /locations/[slug]. Full static build.
- Sitemap generates dynamically from JSON on every build.
- Data update flow: edit JSON → npm run build → commit → push → Vercel rebuild (~2-3 min).
- AffiliateLink stores affiliate tag in URL at JSON-write time; component renders rel="nofollow sponsored noopener".
- Codebase already exists — stories extend and refactor the live site, not greenfield.

### UX Design Requirements

UX-DR1: AtlasNav global search — dropdown max 8 results, keyboard nav (ArrowDown/Up/Enter/Escape), result rows show location name + country + reef state pill, closes on outside mousedown or navigation, input clears on navigation. Enter with no result selected routes to /search?q=.

A first-time visitor understands what the site is within 10 seconds. Susan discovers remarkable reefs by browsing on her phone without touching a filter. Search results, active filter state, and the full mobile experience are complete.
**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR22, FR23, FR24, FR25, FR37, FR38, NFR1, NFR4

### Epic 3: Location Intelligence
A diver researching a region gets a complete picture — editorial context, species aggregated across all sites, live sightings feed, thermal status, getting-there logistics. Witnessing change locations tell the honest story first.
**FRs covered:** FR16, FR17, FR18, FR19, FR20, FR21, FR35, FR40, NFR2

### Epic 4: Site Detail & Species Profiles
A diver arriving cold on a site page from Google gets a complete dive briefing — conditions, species with evidence, numbered dive sequence, and a linkable species detail sub-page. Cert landing pages are current.
**FRs covered:** FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR15, FR26, FR27, FR39, FR41, NFR1, NFR2

### Epic 5: Evidence Backfill & Data Confidence
The species-chaser promise becomes honest — zero-evidence site count drops below 20 (from 136), and every site card clearly signals whether confirmed sighting records exist.
**FRs covered:** FR34, FR35

### Epic 6: Data Depth — MERMAID & IUCN
Reef health shows a trend, not just a snapshot. Coral cover displays multi-year trajectory via MERMAID. IUCN conservation status badges go live (non-commercial use — no license blocker).
**FRs covered:** FR36, UX-DR6 (IucnBadge activate), NFR2

---

## Epic 1: Design System & Core Components

Every page delivers a coherent, intentional design language. Shared components are built once and used everywhere — users experience consistency from nav to footer on every route.

### Story 1.1: Design tokens, logo mark, and wordmark

As a developer,
I want the Tailwind config and global CSS to define the Option D logo mark, weight-split wordmark, and all reef state / freshness color tokens,
So that every component shares a single visual source of truth with no hardcoded overrides.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the Tailwind config and globals.css are updated
**When** any component references a reef state color
**Then** Thriving resolves to `#10b981`, Under pressure to `#0089de`, Witnessing change to `#f43f5e`

**Given** Noto Sans is loaded
**When** font weight 300 or 900 is referenced
**Then** those weights render correctly (both added to the Google Fonts import)

**Given** the `<Logo>` component renders on a light background
**When** it is visible
**Then** it shows the Option D SVG mark (solid `#0089de` circle r=16, primary white wave stroke-width 2 opacity 1.0, secondary wave rgba(255,255,255,0.4) stroke-width 1.5, viewBox 0 0 36 36) adjacent to the stacked wordmark ("scuba" weight 300 `#94a3b8` tracking 0.08em, "Season.fun" weight 900 `#0f172a` tracking -0.05em, line-height 1.0, no color on .fun)

**Given** the `<Logo dark>` prop is passed
**When** it renders on a dark background
**Then** "scuba" is `rgba(255,255,255,0.3)` and "Season.fun" is `#fff`

**Given** any user-facing string in the codebase
**When** rendered
**Then** it contains no hyphen characters in compound adjectives — em dashes (—) are acceptable

---

### Story 1.2: AtlasNav with live search dropdown

As a visitor,
I want a sticky navigation bar with a live search dropdown,
So that I can reach any location directly from any page.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** any page renders
**When** the nav is visible
**Then** AtlasNav is sticky, shows `<Logo>`, three nav links (Atlas `/`, Method `/data`, About `/about`), and a search input — active link is brand blue text only, no underline or background pill

**Given** the user types ≥1 character in the search input
**When** results match
**Then** a dropdown renders with max 8 results; each row shows location name, country, and a reef-state pill

**Given** the dropdown is open
**When** the user presses ArrowDown / ArrowUp
**Then** the selection cursor moves through results, wrapping at both ends

**Given** a result is highlighted and the user presses Enter
**When** the navigation fires
**Then** the browser navigates to `/locations/[slug]` and the input clears

**Given** the user presses Escape or clicks outside the search widget
**When** the event fires
**Then** the dropdown closes

**Given** the user presses Enter with no highlighted result
**When** the Enter key fires
**Then** the user is routed to `/search?q=[query]`

**Given** the search input renders
**When** a screen reader announces it
**Then** it reads "Search reefs" via `aria-label`

---

### Story 1.3: AtlasFooter component

As a visitor,
I want a consistent footer with contact info and navigation links,
So that I can reach methodology, about, and contact from any page.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** any page renders
**When** the user scrolls to the bottom
**Then** AtlasFooter appears with a dark ink (`#0b1e32`) background

**Given** the footer renders
**When** inspected
**Then** three columns: (1) `<Logo dark>` + tagline in Source Serif 4 italic; (2) links to Atlas, Method, About; (3) `hello@scubaseason.fun` mailto + contact note

**Given** the bottom bar renders
**When** visible
**Then** shows `© 2026 scubaSeason.fun` + data attribution line; no newsletter form, no social links, no upsell

---

### Story 1.4: DataFreshnessLabel component

As a visitor,
I want data age labels that distinguish live satellite feeds from years-old field surveys,
So that I can calibrate my trust in any number without hunting for a footnote.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** `<DataFreshnessLabel variant="live" source="NOAA CRW" date={today} />` renders
**When** visible
**Then** shows green dot (`#10b981`), "Live · NOAA CRW · updated [date]" at 10.5px font-semibold uppercase tracked; entire pill links to `/data`

**Given** `<DataFreshnessLabel variant="snapshot" date="2021-03-01" />` renders
**When** visible
**Then** shows amber dot; appends "(N years ago)" when survey is >2 years old

**Given** `<DataFreshnessLabel variant="presence" source="iNaturalist" />` renders
**When** visible
**Then** shows slate dot and "Presence data · iNaturalist · no population trend"

**Given** any DataFreshnessLabel renders
**When** keyboard-focused
**Then** a visible focus ring appears

---

### Story 1.5: AffiliateLink and AffiliateDisclosure components

As a visitor,
I want affiliate links to be clearly labeled and fire analytics events,
So that I know when I'm clicking a commercial link and the site can track performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** `<AffiliateLink isAffiliate={true}>` wraps a URL
**When** it renders
**Then** the anchor has `rel="nofollow sponsored noopener"`, `target="_blank"`, and a visible commission indicator

**Given** a visitor clicks an affiliate link
**When** the click fires
**Then** Vercel Analytics receives the correct event (`gear_click` / `lodging_click` / `operator_click` / `flight_click`) with `{ site_id, partner, product_id }`

**Given** `<AffiliateLink isAffiliate={false}>`
**When** it renders
**Then** no commission indicator appears and no analytics event fires — renders as a plain external link

**Given** a page section contains affiliate links
**When** it renders
**Then** `<AffiliateDisclosure>` appears at the bottom of that section

---

### Story 1.6: FreshnessDot, LiveBadge, and IucnBadge components

As a visitor,
I want data currency and conservation status communicated with consistent visual indicators,
So that I can scan any panel and instantly understand how current the data is and what a species' status means.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** `<FreshnessDot days={200} />`
**When** visible
**Then** renders amber dot (`#e8962f`, 5px circle) — Fresh green (`#10b981`) <365 days, Stale amber 365–1095, Cold red (`#e23a3a`) >1095 or null — always paired with a text label

**Given** `<LiveBadge label="Updated tonight" />`
**When** visible
**Then** renders `#10b981` dot with glow `box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(21,160,92,0.25)`, pill bg `rgba(21,160,92,0.1)`, border `rgba(21,160,92,0.2)`, text `#15804d`, 0.75rem/700

**Given** `<IucnBadge status="VU" />` and `IUCN_ENABLED === true`
**When** visible
**Then** renders flat amber chip "VU" with `#fde8cc` bg and `#9a3412` text

**Given** `IUCN_ENABLED === false`
**When** any `<IucnBadge>` renders
**Then** renders nothing — no layout shift

---

### Story 1.7: SightingRow and FilterSummaryBar components

As a visitor,
I want species sighting records and active filter state in a scannable format,
So that I can assess evidence quality at a glance and remove individual filters without resetting everything.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** `<SightingRow>` with a <30-day observation
**When** visible
**Then** shows green 8px dot, species common name (0.875rem/600 `#0f172a`), site + meta (0.75rem muted), iNaturalist obs ID as external link, date in `<time dateTime="[ISO]">`

**Given** `<FilterSummaryBar>` with a Thriving reef state filter active
**When** visible
**Then** Thriving pill uses `#10b981` token; other filter pills use brand/10 bg + brand text; each pill has an × dismiss; "Reset all filters" link is right-aligned; live count "Showing N locations" renders

**Given** the × on a filter pill is clicked
**When** the event fires
**Then** only that filter value is removed; all others remain; URL updates via `router.replace`

**Given** chips overflow one line
**When** rendered
**Then** they wrap to a second line in order: reef state → cert → region → month → thermal → wildlife → fresh-only

---

### Story 1.8: StatStrip and EditorialHook components

As a visitor,
I want key facts in a compact horizontal strip and an honest editorial paragraph before data,
So that I orient immediately on any detail page and understand the voice alongside the numbers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** `<StatStrip stats={[...6 items]} />`
**When** visible
**Then** each stat shows label (0.5875rem/700/0.12em tracked uppercase muted), value (1rem/700 ink), optional note (0.6875rem muted); hairline right borders between items; `{colors.surface}` background

**Given** `<StatStrip>` on mobile (<768px)
**When** the user swipes
**Then** strip scrolls horizontally, no visible scrollbar, all 6 stats accessible

**Given** any stat value
**When** page loads
**Then** value is static — no count-up animation

**Given** `<EditorialHook text="..." />`
**When** visible
**Then** renders in Source Serif 4, 1.0625rem, line-height 1.8, `#334155`, max-width 640px

---

### Story 1.9: Methodology disclosure and accessibility floor

As a user relying on assistive technology,
I want all data claims to have inline expandable methodology disclosures and all interactive elements to meet WCAG AA,
So that I can understand how every number is calculated and navigate fully by keyboard.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** `<MethodologyDisclosure>` wraps a data claim
**When** visible
**Then** uses native `<details>/<summary>` only — no JS, no modal; summary shows info circle icon (14px muted) + "How is this calculated?"

**Given** any decorative SVG, dot, or sparkline
**When** rendered
**Then** has `aria-hidden="true"`

**Given** any globe marker
